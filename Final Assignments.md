**AIS5101: End-of-Course Assessment**

Your end-of-course assessment includes two parts: a **Mock internship
interview** and an **Essay task**. You will be assessed on both your
performance during the interview and the quality of your essays.

The activities are designed to help you reflect on your understanding of
key concepts, apply what you have learned to scenario-based questions,
and practice real-world communication skills.

# Mock Internship Interview

**Overview**:

- In this activity, you will take part in a **2.5-minute** mock
  internship interview. We will ask you **one** question randomly
  selected from the provided pool of mock internship questions (Section
  3).

- This activity gives you practical experience in answering
  interview-style questions clearly, logically, and confidently -- the
  same skills valued in real internship and job interviews.

**Interview schedule**:

| Date | Group |
| --- | --- |
| 3 Nov 2025 | 1 |
| 6 Nov 2025 | 2 |
| 10 Nov 2025 | 3 |
| 13 Nov 2025 | 4 |

The list of students in each group is provided in Section 4

**Preparation**:

- A set of mock internship questions (Section 3) is provided to help you
  prepare your answers in advance. Review them carefully.

- Prepare and practice your responses.

**Assessment**:

During the interview, the panel will assess your:

1.  **Content** (50%): how accurate and relevant your answer is.

2.  **Originality and critical thinking** (20%): how well you present
    your own perspective, analysis, or insights.

3.  **Structure and clarity** (20%): how logically your answer is organized and how clearly the ideas are communicated.

4.  **Confidence** (10%): how comfortable and assured you sound when
    speaking.

*Tip*: practice with a friend or record yourself answering a few
questions, it helps you get used to speaking naturally under time
pressure.

# Essay Task

**Overview**:

- You will complete a short **essay assignment on 5 questions** selected
  from the same pool of mock internship questions (Section 3) below.

- This activity helps you reflect more deeply on your ideas and
  demonstrate your ability to express them clearly in writing.

**What to do:**

- Choose **5 questions** from the question pool (Section 3).

- Write an answer of **no more than 200 words for each question**.

- Keep your writing concise and focused -- answer each question directly
  and logically.

**Submission**:

- Complete your essays using the provided [Submission template](https://canvas.nus.edu.sg/courses/77534/files/folder/Interviews%26Essay?preview=7747271).
- Submit your assignment as a **Microsoft Word (.docx)** file only, containing all 5 essays.
- Name your file using the format **[Student_ID]\_[Last_name]\_[First_name].docx**.
- Submit your assignment to Canvas by **21 Nov 2025, 23:59**. 
  
  Late submissions will be penalized:
    - Up to 24 hours late: 10% deduction from total grade.
    - 24–48 hours late: 20% deduction from total grade.
    - More than 48 hours late: submission will not be accepted.

**Assessment:**

Each essay carries **20 points**.

Your essays will be assessed based on:

- **Content** (50%): how well you address the question and apply
  relevant concepts or ideas.

- **Originality and critical thinking** (20%): how well you present your
  own perspective, analysis, or insights.

- **Structure** (20%): how logically you organize your response.

- **Clarity** (10%): how easy your writing is to follow and understand.

*Note on word limit:*

Your response to each question should be **no more than 200 words**.
Exceeding it by more than 5% of the word limit for a single essay will
result in a deduction of 10% of the points for that essay.

# Mock Internship Interview Questions

| Questions |
| ----------|                                                    
| Q1: Imagine you're joining a new team and you find that the dataset you need to work on lacks clear records of how it was collected or processed. How would you ensure the data provenance is well understood before building your model? | 
| Q2: Can you describe a dataset you have worked with - or discussed in class - that has poor-quality data, and explain the steps you took to improve it before running any analysis? | 
| Q3: Suppose you're analyzing a dataset that shows a strong correlation between two variables. How would you explain to a non-technical colleague why that correlation doesn’t necessarily mean one causes the other? |
| Q4: Describe a project where it is important to reduce the dimensionality of your data. What methods did you use, and how did it help you solve the problem? |
| Q5: Imagine you're working with a complex dataset and suspect the data lies on a lower-dimensional manifold. How would you uncover that structure, and why would that be useful? |
| Q6: Can you share an example where you had to choose between a supervised and an unsupervised learning approach in a scientific problem. What factors guided your decision? |
| Q7: Suppose you're trying to cluster a large set of experimental results to identify common patterns. How might vector quantization help, and what would you look for in the resulting clusters? |
| Q8: Tell me about a time when you had to explain to a team member why your model performs well when interpolating within the data range but might not be reliable when extrapolating beyond it? |
| Q9: Imagine you've developed a generative model that can suggest multiple hypotheses/possibilities about possible mechanism. How would you use those generated insights to guide real-world experiments? |
| Q10: Can you describe a situation where your choice of loss function strongly influenced the outcome of your scientific model, and how you explained that choice to others? |
